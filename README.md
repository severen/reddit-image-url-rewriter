# Reddit Image URL Rewriter

This extension mostly does what it says on the tin. It rewrites URLs of the form
`https://preview.redd.it/<hash>.jpg?<params>` to `https://i.redd.it/<hash>.jpg` when
they are opened in a new tab. This is useful because it allows you to directly view
and/or save the original full-sized JPG file instead of the preview WebP file that
Reddit serves on the `preview.redd.it` domain.
